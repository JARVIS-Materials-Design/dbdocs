Using jarvis.core.Atoms class several atomistic properties such as lattice parameters, density, packing fraction etc. can be calculated. The optimized lattice parameters generally compare well with DFT data except for the FFs where a particular phase was not trained during FF-fitting. Similarly, energetics in terms of convex hull plot is compared between DFT and FF results.
Similarly, elastic tensor and derived properties were predicted using LAMMPS runs and comapred with DFT data.
For the defect formation energies, we consider vacancies and free-surfaces which are generated by the modules in the JARVIS-Tools. 
Phonon data from JARVIS-DFT and JARVIS-FF can be compared for a system to evaluate the phonon quality. However, it is important to note that in DFT there might be only conventional cell Gamma-point phonon data available whereas in JARVIS-FF we use supercell finite difference-based approach for obtaining phonon density of states and bandstructures. For a known stable material if the phonon bandstructure shows high negative values then it signifies the FF maynot be suitable to predict correct dynamical properties of the system.
