Machine learning has several applications in materials science and engineering, such as automating experimental data analysis, discovering new functional materials, optimizing known ones by accelerating conventional methods such as DFT, automating literature searches, discovering new physical equations, and efficient clustering of materials and their properties. There are several data types that can be used in ML such as scalar data (e.g., formation energies, bandgaps), vector/spectra data (e.g., density of states, dielectric function, charge density, X-ray diffraction patterns, etc.), image-based data (such as scanning tunneling microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images), and natural language processing-based data (such as scientific papers). In addition, ML can be applied on a variety of materials classes such as bulk crystals, molecules, proteins and free-surfaces.
