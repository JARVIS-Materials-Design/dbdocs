The enthalpy of formation is the standard reaction enthalpy for the formation of the compound from its elements (atoms or molecules) in their most stable reference states. We report formation energies at 0K only based on energies directly obtained from the DFT especially with OptB88vdW functional. We have calculated the elemental energies (in respective crystalline forms) and treat those energies as the chemical potential. These chemical potentials are subtracted from the total energies of the system to predict the formation energies. If functional other than OptB88vdW is used then the unary energy needs to be provided.
