Wannier functions (WF) were first introduced in 1937, and have proven to be a powerful tool in the investigation of solid-state phenomenon such as polarization, topology, and magnetization. WTBH is not necessarily a material properties but can be useful in calculating several material properties. Mathematically, WFs are a complete orthonormalized basis set that act as a bridge between a delocalized plane wave representation commonly used in electronic structure calculations and a localized atomic orbital basis that more naturally describes chemical bonds. One of the most common ways of obtaining Wannier tight-bonding Hamiltonians (WTBH) is by using the Wannier90 software package to generate maximally localized Wannier functions, based on underlying density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
