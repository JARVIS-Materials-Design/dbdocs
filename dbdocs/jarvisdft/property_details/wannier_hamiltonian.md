Wannier functions (WF) were first introduced in 1937, and have proven to be a powerful tool in the investigation of solid-state phenomenon such as polarization, topology, and magnetization. WTBH is not necessarily a material properties but can be useful in calculating several material properties. Mathematically, WFs are a complete orthonormalized basis set that act as a bridge between a delocalized plane wave representation commonly used in electronic structure calculations and a localized atomic orbital basis that more naturally describes chemical bonds. One of the most common ways of obtaining Wannier tight-bonding Hamiltonians (WTBH) is by using the Wannier90 software package to generate maximally localized Wannier functions, based on underlying density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Wannier bands compared with explicit DFT bands to assess the accuracy of the Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians. For example:
