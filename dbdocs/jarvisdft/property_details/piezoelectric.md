The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process where materials exhibit electrical polarization resulting from an applied mechanical stress, or conversely, a strain due to an applied electric field. Common applications for piezoelectricity include medical applications, energy harvesting devices, actuators, sensors, motors, atomic force microscopes, and high voltage power generation. PZ responses can be measured under constant strain, giving the piezoelectric stress tensor e_ij  or constant stress, giving the piezoelectric strain tensor d_ij . The PZ data is obtained using DFPT method discussed above. Piezoelectric tensor is a 3x3 matrix. A distribution of the PZ tensor components is shown below:
