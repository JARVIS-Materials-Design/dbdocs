EFG is a key parameter used to define Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) spectral lines EFG is defined as the second derivative in Cartesian coordinates of the Coulomb potential at the nucleus position. By construction, the EFG, Vii is a traceless tensor. The coordinate system, in accordance with the convention used by experimentalists is chosen so that |V_zz |≥|V_yy |≥|V_xx |, which forces 0≤η<1. Note that if the point group of the site in question is cubic, then by symmetry all components are zero.
