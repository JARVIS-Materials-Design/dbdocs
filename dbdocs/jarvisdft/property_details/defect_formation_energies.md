Defect formation energies are available for a few 2D materials. For neutral defect formation energies, we generate a at least 11 Angs. Cell for 2D materials and create point defects using unique Wyckoff information. The total energy of the defect system, the energy of the perfect 2D crystal and the elemental chemical potential is then used to predict the defect formation energies. Currently this property is available for OptB88vdW functional only.
