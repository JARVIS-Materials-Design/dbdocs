Since the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM), this technique has become an essential tool for characterizing material surfaces and adsorbates. In addition to providing atomic insights, STM has been proven useful for characterizing the electronic structure, shapes of molecular orbitals, and vibrational and magnetic excitations. It can also be used for manipulating adsorbates and adatoms, and for catalysis and quantum information processing applications. Few examples of computational STM is given below:
 

Fig.  STM images for which we qualitatively compared computational positive bias images. We compare computational STM images with that of experiments for graphene16, 2H-MoS217, 2H-NbSe218, 2H-WSe219,  1Tâ€™-WTe220, FeSe21, black-P22,23, SnSe24, Bismuth surface57,58.  The JVASP identifiers can be used to visualize the detailed webpage for each material.
