Topological materials driven by spin-orbit coupling have different bandgaps with/without spin orbit coupling effects. Spillage is calculated by comparing the wavefunctions of these two bandstructures. We calculate the spillage values for a large set of low bandgap and high atomic mass materials, with a spillage value of 0.5 as a threshold to screen for potential topologically non-trivial materials. The threshold denotes number of band-inverted electrons. This criterion can be used for predicting non-trivial topological behavior of metals, semiconductors and both perfect and defective structures.
