After obtaining the initial structures from several databases, we optimize following JARVIS-DFT protocols of a) converging k-points, b) converging cut-off, c) converging energy, d) converging forces. These final optimized structures are analyzed in terms of statistical functions such as radial distribution function, angular distribution function, dihedral distribution function, X-ray diifraction pattern etc. to know about the local atomisitic environments that controls several material-properties.
