EDOS is a spectrum of the number of allowed electron energy levels (occupied and unoccupied) against energy interval (generally in electron volt). EDOS is generally calculated based on a dense k-point grid with a smoothening/smearing setup. EDOS is generally rescaled with respect to the Fermi-energy of the system. A high value for the DOS represents a high number for the electronic states that can be occupied. Experimental methods such as scanning tunneling microscopy can be used obtain EDOS. One of the obvious properties that can be calculated from EDOS is the bandgap. EDOS can be based on total density of states or further resolved into atom-projected and element-projected density of states. The projected EDOS provides information about the particular electronic orbitals (say s,p,d,f) and specific atom (say Si) contributing towards a particular energy level. We calculate EDOS for both semi-local, HSE06 and PBE0 methods. At least, DOS is provided at local or semilocal materials for all the materials. An example is shown below:
