Thermoelectrics1-4 are materials that can convert a temperature gradient into electric voltage, or vice-versa. Themoelectrics can be used to regenerate electricity from waste heat5, refrigeration6 and several other space-technology applications7,8. The search for efficient thermoelectric materials is an area of intense research due the potential of converting waste heat into electrical power, and therefore improving energy efficiency and reducing fossil fuel usage. The figure of merit for thermoelectric materials is the dimensionless quantity zT:
                                                                             zT=(S^2 σ)/(k_e+k_l ) T 			
where S, σ, ke, kl, and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, electronic part of thermal conductivity, lattice thermal conductivity, and temperature, respectively. The numerator, S^2 σ, is referred to as the power-factor. To achieve a high zT, a material should have a high-power factor and low thermal conductivity.

Fig.  A brief overview of the thermoelectric data for periodic bulk materials. Figure a) -f) have been computed on all 3D materials, while g-i) display properties only computed on the set of bulk screened materials (bandgap>0.05 eV, n-type and p-type PF>1000 (μW/(mK)2) at 600 K and 1020 cm-3 doping concentration). a) n-type Seebeck coefficient distribution, b) n-type power factor of materials, c) n-type electrical conducitivity plotted against the absolute values of Seebeck-coefficient with color-coded power-factor and size of the dots proportional to bandgaps, d) p-type Seebeck coefficient distribution, e) p-type power factor of materials, f) p-type power factor plotted against the bandgaps, g) predicted dimensionality distribution of screened materials, h) space-group distribution of the screened materials, i) power-factor vs Seebeck distribution of the screened materials.

 
Fig.  Periodic table trends of high-power factor materials. The elements in a material were assigned 1 or 0 if the material has high or low n-type power-factor (>1000 (μW/(mK)2)). Then the probability of finding the element in a high power-factor material was calculated.
