Thermoelectrics are materials that can convert a temperature gradient into electric voltage, or vice-versa. Themoelectrics can be used to regenerate electricity from waste heat, refrigeration and several other space-technology applications. The search for efficient thermoelectric materials is an area of intense research due the potential of converting waste heat into electrical power, and therefore improving energy efficiency and reducing fossil fuel usage.
