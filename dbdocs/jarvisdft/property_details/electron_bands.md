Following the laws of quantum mechanics only certain energy levels are allowed and others could be forbidden. These levels  can be discrete or spilt, called bands. Electronic bands depend on crystal momentum leading to bandstructure. The allowed states which are filled (upto the Fermi level) are valence bands while the unoccupied bands are conduction bands.  The difference in energy between the conduction and valence band gives rise to the bandgaps. The materials with no bandgap are termed metals, with low bandgap semiconductors and with high bandgaps insulators. We calculate bandstructure using local, semi-local as well as hybrid functionals.
