Dielectric materials are important components in many electronic devices such as capacitors, field-effect transistors computer memory (DRAM), sensors and communication circuits. Both high and low-value DL materials have applications in different technologies. Static dielectric constants with both ionic and electronic contributions are obtained using DFPT method. The electronic part of the dielectric constant is generally in close agreement with that obtained from the linear optics method mentioned above.
