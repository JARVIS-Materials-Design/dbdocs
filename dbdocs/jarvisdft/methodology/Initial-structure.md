The initial/input crystal structures were obtained from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database, Materials Project, OQMD, AFLOW, COD databases. These input structures are then subjected to a set of geometric and electronic optimizations (discussed below) following JARVIS-DFT workflow protocols. After the geometric optimization, several materials properties are calculated (discussed below). A typical flow chart is shown below:
