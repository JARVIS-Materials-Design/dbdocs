To obtain the optical properties of the materials, we calculated the imaginary part of the dielectric function from the Bloch wavefunctions and eigenvalues (neglecting local field effects) (LOPTICS=.TRUE.). We introduced three times as many empty conduction bands as valance bands. This treatment is necessary to facilitate proper electronic transitions. We choose 5000 energy grid points to have a sufficiently high resolution in dielectric function spectra. Several properties such as absorption coefficient, solar-cell efficiency, and reflectivity can be predicted with the dielectric function data. Note that due to bandgap underestimation the peaks may beshifted. A better method such as TBmBJ, HSE06, G0W0 is necessary for predicting better behavior.
