The partial charge densities are used to calculate scanning tunneling microscopy images. The surface charge and probability densities are calculated by integrating the local density of states function (ILDOS) over an energy range of Â±0.5 eV from the conduction band minima (CBM) to Fermi energy (EF) and valence band maxima (VBM) to Fermi energy (EF). The STM images are calculated using Tersoff-Hamann approach.
