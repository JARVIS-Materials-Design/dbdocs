DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab-initio simulation package (VASP) software using the workflow given on our JARVIS-Tools github page ([https://github.com/usnistgov/jarvis](https://github.com/usnistgov/jarvis)). We use the projected augmented wave method .  Both the internal atomic positions and the lattice constants are allowed to relax in spin-unrestricted calculations until the maximal residual Hellmann–Feynman forces on atoms are smaller than 0.001 eV Å−1 and energy-tolerance of 10-7 eV with accurate precision setting (PREC=Accurate). Note that force convergence is very important for properties such as phonons, elastic constants etc. We use spin-polarized set-up with initial magnetic moment of default value 1 muB during geometric optimization. Also use conjugate gradient algorithm for ionic relaxation (IBRION=2).
