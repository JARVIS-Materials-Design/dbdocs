 We carry out the Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) (as implemented in the VASP code, IBRION=8) calculation on the standard conventional cell for each material. We determine the Born-effective charge, piezoelectric and dielectric (ionic+electronic parts) tensors and the phonon eigenvectors. DFPT is also used to calculate Infrared and Raman intensities for selected materials. As mentioned earlier, it is important to converge K-points, cut-off and parameters to get reliable results which is taken into account in the JARVIS-DFT.
