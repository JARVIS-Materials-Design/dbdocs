Spin-orbit coupling usually split states that are degenerate in a nonrelativistic description. We consider spin-orbit coupling (LSORBIT = .TRUE.) only during spin-orbit spillage calculations for topological materials  but not during geometric optimization or any other major property calculations. We take into account only scalar relativistic effects.  Accurate lattice-constants of materials with vdW bonding can play a critical role in predicting the correct topology, as emphasized. We calculate the spillage using the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)  functional and 1000/atom k-points, as well as by analyzing the spillage along a high-symmetry Brillouin-zone path, with a 600 eV plane-wave cut-off.
