JARVIS-DFT contains data using conventional local and semi-local methods, as well as beyond conventional DFT based methods such as meta-GGA (TBmBJ), G0W0, HSE06, PBE0, DMFT etc. BDFT methods are used to better predict electronic bandgaps, dielectric functions hence solar-cell efficiencies, as well magnetic moment (using DMFT) of a material. HSE06 and PBE0 were used to predict accurate bandgaps for exfoliable bulk and corresponding monolayer materials.  We utilized two hybrid functionals: PBE0 and HSE06. In PBE0 the exchange energy is given by a 3:1 ratio mix of the PBE and Hartree–Fock exchange energies, respectively, while the correlation is completely given by the  PBE correlation energy. In HSE (Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof)32, the exchange is given by a screened Coulomb potential, to improve computational efficiency. An adjustable parameter (ω) controls how short range the interaction is. HSE06 is characterized by ω=0.2, while for a choice of ω=0 HSE becomes PBE0.
