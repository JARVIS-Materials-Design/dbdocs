The transport properties were calculated using the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) implemented in the BoltzTrap code. The BTE is used to investigate the non-equilibrium behavior of electrons and holes by statistically averaging all possible quantum states. The computation of the relaxation time is very computationally expensive, especially in a high-throughput context, hence a constant relaxation time approach is used here.
